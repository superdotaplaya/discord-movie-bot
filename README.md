# discord-movie-bot
A simple bot for discord to allow users to manage a list of movies/shows they would like to watch as a community.


Usage:

1.) Add the bot to your server: https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1274929108903788665

2.) If you have a thread with movies/shows to add, @ the bot in the thread, ensure each movie/show is in its own message, and run the command /addmovie_batch [genre]
3.) after your backog has been added, use /addmovie to add movies each time you would like to add one!


Picking movies!

1.) Use the command /pickmovie [genre[ to pick a random movie in that genre, use "all" as the genre to select a completely random movie.


Notes: This is a public bot, but all movies are stored ina  list for each discord server seperately, so only your movies will be chosen, and available to be chosen for your server! Use it for any movie and shows you want without worrying about the movies being chosen by the wrong server!
